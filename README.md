#Scratch Key Remapper
Let's you remap the keys inside event and sensing "when key pressed" blocks.
How to use:
- Download project of choice
- replace .sb3 extension with .zip
- open zip
- Upload the "project.json" file inside the zip
- Set old and new key values to whatever you like. Defaults to Scratch-3ds keybinds.
- Press Convert button. If nothing downloads, press it again.
- Replace old project.sb3 in zip with new project.sb3. Make sure it is still named "project.sb3"!
- rename zip file back to .sb3. Make sure you change the extension and not just the name!
