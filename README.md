# Scratch Key Remapper
Let's you remap the keys inside event and sensing "when key pressed" blocks.
### How to use:
1. Download Scratch project of choice.
2. Upload the Scratch project to website. (All code is client side, so your project is only stored on your computer.)
3. Set old and new key values to whatever you like. Defaults to Scratch-3ds keybinds.
4. Press Convert button.

Uses the library zip.js to open the project: https://gildas-lormeau.github.io/zip.js/
