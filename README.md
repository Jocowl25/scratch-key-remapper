#Scratch Key Remapper
Let's you remap the keys inside event and sensing "when key pressed" blocks.
How to use:
1. Download Scratch project of choice
2. Replace .sb3 extension with .zip
3. Open zip
4. Upload the "project.json" file inside the zip
5. Set old and new key values to whatever you like. Defaults to Scratch-3ds keybinds
6. Press Convert button. If nothing downloads, press it again
7. Replace old project.sb3 in zip with new project.sb3. Make sure it is still named "project.sb3"!
8. Rename zip file back to .sb3. Make sure you change the extension and not just the name!
